		<h4>The Tivoli offers the right combination of power, features, and aesthetic appeal at the right price. Stylish LED Daytime Running Lights adorn its front fascia, which goes well with the head-turning front hood character line. The matte black lower portion, fog lamps and mesh grille give it a sporty look. The inside of the Tivoli is just as good outside. It boasts the Supervision Cluster instrument gauge panel, which is designed to help alleviate driving difficulties at night. A Smart Steer system allows the driver to switch from three steering modes â€“ Normal, Comfort, and Sport. It also features rear parking sensor, keyless entry, and alarm. Buyer can opt between a 1.6-liter gasoline engine that delivers 126 hp and 160 Nm of torque or a more peppy 1.6-liter turbo diesel that produces 134 hp and 324 Nm of torque. Both engines are then coupled with a 6-speed automatic transmission.
