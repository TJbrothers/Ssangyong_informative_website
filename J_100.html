		<h4>At first glance, the J100 is rather in-your-face; its frontal styling is bold with contrasting geometric elements, angular LED lighting and a chiselled hood. Powerfully dynamic front and rear fenders give it a staunch stance, as does the chunky lower black plastic cladding. Thereâ€™s even a Land Rover Discovery vibe with its separate rear quarter windows and C-pillars, which wrap up and over the roof. As with its smaller Korando sibling, the J100 will also be cleverly packaged, offering more space than its dimensions suggest. Technophiles will be catered for with a large digital drivers display, ambient lighting, wireless phone charging, WiFi connectivity, and a heads-up display. A plethora of driver-assists, including lane-keeping assist, road sign recognition, AEB with pedestrian detection and full-range adaptive cruise control, will also be available.</h4>
