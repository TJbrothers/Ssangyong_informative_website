		<h4>The Rexton makes a solid impression by seamlessly blending its strong rugged stance with the elegance of its finely chiseled lines. The result, an undeniably commanding presence on the road. The seats are ergonomically designed to conform to the shape of each body, thereby mitigating feelings of fatigue on long trips. They are covered in incredibly soft and relaxing Nappa leather that has been elegantly quilted. The interior ambience is further enhanced by the illuminated front door scuff, and lamps built into the instrument panel and door trim to create a subtle ambient light at night.</h4>
