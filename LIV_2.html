		<h4>Finished in matte and gloss white, the LIV-2 has a grille designed to resemble the spread wings of a bird a feature first seen on the Ssangyong Tivoli and one that will become a regular sight on future Ssangyongs, as will the sculpted details on the sides.
			Other features include electric sidesteps and technology that creates an illuminated path for occupants approaching or leaving the car.
			The interior has been designed to emulate both a luxury limousine and an executive lounge, with particular focus on rear passengers. Each gets a reclining individual chair, complete with a massage function. The interior is finished in leather with patterned and piano black accents, while mood lighting has been installed to highlight the centre console and door panels.</h4>
